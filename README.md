## Courted
 A discord bot that adds a legal system to your discord server.

# How does it work?
It works by making a channel when someone does `/court`, and allowing people to be assigned as Judges and Lawyers, before a full scale court battle takes place!

# How to install it?
Clone the repo, change .env and run `npm install` and `npm start`!
